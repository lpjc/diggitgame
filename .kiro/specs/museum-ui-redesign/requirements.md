# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Museum UI Redesign feature transforms the museum experience from a simple grid view into an engaging, collection-style interface. This redesign introduces a compact masonry layout with a scrolling background of artifact thumbnails, sticky navigation controls, and enhanced discovery tracking that celebrates players who find artifacts first. The feature builds on the existing artifact persistence system to create a more immersive and visually appealing museum experience.
